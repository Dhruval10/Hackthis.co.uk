Another chapter in the HackThis! series, featuring Main Level 5 today.

Our hint is:

Slightly more complicated JavaScript this time, but just as insecure.

Refresh to try again.

Note that we can obtain this by simply inserting any password, or clicking “Cancel”, when the first password prompt pops up.

Again, we look into the source code to find hints. We hit Ctrl + F and browse for “javascript”, since our only hint is telling us that JavaScript is still being used. This is what we find, from line 849 onwards:

1.	var pass;
2.	pass=prompt("Password","");
3.	if (pass=="9286jas") {
4.      	  window.location.href="/levels/main/5?pass=9286jas";
5.	}

There goes our solution. We refresh the page, input the password, and pass the level.
