Continuing the HackThis! series, we will be looking into the solution of Main Level 7 today.

This time, the hint says:

The password is again stored in a txt file. This time however it is not as straight forward as viewing the source.

You wouldn't even find the page by using a search engine as search bots have been excluded.

The first important hint we receive is that looking at the source code will, this time, do us no good. However, there is also another implicit hint in there: “search bots have been excluded”. What does this mean? To understand what to do, we will have to look into the Robots exclusion standard, a standard used by websites in their interactions with web robots. This standard can also be used to exclude given website directories from search.

What does that mean? That if we can read the robots.txt file of HackThis!, then we will know which files and/or directories have been excluded from search. And what is the path to the robots.txt file on Wikipedia? It is en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt.

Therefore, we navigate to http://www.hackthis.co.uk/robots.txt, which reads:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /contact.php
Disallow: /inbox/
Disallow: /levels/
Disallow: /levels/extras/userpass.txt
Disallow: /users/
Disallow: /ctf/8/php/*

User-agent: Mediapartners-Google
Disallow:

Sitemap: https://www.hackthis.co.uk/sitemap.xml

There is one .txt file that stands out in this bunch. We then navigate to http://www.hackthis.co.uk/levels/extras/userpass.txt, which reads:

Input the first in the username field and the second in the password field. You are now done.
