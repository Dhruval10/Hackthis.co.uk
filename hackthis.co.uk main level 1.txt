As a newbie in the hacking world, I figured I would pick somewhere to start practicing and having fun with. My eyes were then set on HackThis!, which I made a point of eventually completing.

As I go through the challenges, I will be giving explanations and solutions – with screenshots, if needed – about the challenge levels.

<!-- username: in, password: out -->
And that is our solution.
